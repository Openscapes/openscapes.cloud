title: "Openscapes JupyterHub Usage Reports"
---

We generate monthly reports of usage and costs of AWS resources in the 
NASA-Openscapes and NMFS-Openscapes JupyterHubs.

These reports are generated automatically on the first day of every month using a 
GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/Openscapes/openscapes.cloud/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-usage-report.yml), summarizing 
usage for the preceding month. The report can also be created on demand by 
triggering the workflow manually, by visiting the 
["Render and Save PDF" workflow page](https://github.com/openscapes/openscapes.cloud/actions/workflows/create-usage-report.yml), 
and clicking the "Run Workflow" button in the upper right corner.

Reports are stored in the [reports](_hub-usage-reporting/reports/) directory.

### AWS Cost Explorer

*This is a work in progress, currently with minimal steps and screenshots that we will augment.*

AWS Cost Explorer lets you examine how much your usage costs. When using Credits, your usage does not immediately show up. Select Charge type as "Usage" from the right menu.

### AWS Budgeting Alerts

*This is a work in progress, currently with minimal steps and screenshots that we will augment.*

There are two types of alerts we set up.

#### Budgeting alerts

When adding new Cloud credits to our AWS account, we also create a budget and alerts (received via email) as we spend our credits. These are some beginning notes (credit and thank you to Joe Kennedy!).

Create an annual budget of the total Credits left (you may need to calculate this if credits rolled over at the beginning of the calendar year). In the Budget menu, create a Budget. Then select Customize and Cost budget.

Exclude Credits and Refunds, include Discounts. You can elect to receive emails with a regular cadence: weekly, monthly.

We set these up at 50, 75, 90, 95% of the total budget, and we will receive emails at those percentages. The thinking is that we will need to request more credits starting at 50-75%, and then make sure we have them in hand by 90-95%.

#### Threshold alerts

We can also set up email alerts at certain dollar amounts.

We receive emails when we spend \$100, \$200, \$500 of our Credits, which show up in the system as \$1000 intervals.
