## Individual long-term access

Individuals are given long-term access by adding them as members of the 
`LongtermAccess` team in the relevant organization:

- [NASA-Openscapes LongtermAccess-2i2c team](https://github.com/orgs/NASA-Openscapes/teams/longtermaccess-2i2c)
- [NMFS-Openscapes LongtermAccess-2i2c team](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-openscapes/teams/longterm-access-2i2c)

This is the workflow to add individual users one by one.

### 1. Share Google Form with users needing long-term access

Ask users: Please fill out the Foogle form for Openscapes JupyterHub Access. Users
must have a GitHub username to fill out the form, as this is how they
will be given access to the Hub.

- [NASA-Openscapes form](https://forms.gle/htV2PxJwRaP8jDpC6)
- [NMFS-Openscapes form](https://forms.gle/mP9E46xnJWjFhgmk7)

### 2. Google Form response setup

Set the form responses to notify you by email when there are responses: Click on Responses \> click three vertical dots and then check "email notification."

![](images/google-form-notifications.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="600"}

### 3. Email alert of new signup

When you get an email click '**view response**' (not `view summary`)

![](images/google-form-view-response.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="600"}

::: {.callout-note}

If you are not sure if the access request is valid (i.e., the requestor does not appear to be an Openscapes mentor, staff member or close collaborator etc.), ask the mentor community in Slack to verify if the person requesting access is affiliated with any mentors' work. If not, then send the requestor the following email, and do not add them to the GitHub team:

> Dear XXX, 
>
> Thank you for your interest in our JupyterHub. Currently we provide access to people who participate in workshops taught by NASA Data Center (DAAC) staff through the NASA Openscapes community. We will be adding upcoming events you can sign up for here: https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news.
> 
> Cheers,

Note in the "Notes" column in the Google form response sheet that this email was
sent denying access, and the date.

:::

### 4. Copy GitHub username

On the response page, copy the Github Username 

![](images/google-form-gh-username.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="600"}

### 5. Add GitHub username to the GitHub Team

::: {.callout-tip}
If you are adding many new mentors to the long-term access team, you can use the 
same steps as [for adding workshop participants](#4-add-users-to-a-team-in-a-batch-using-kyber)
:::

Go to the appropriate team in GitHub \> Click Add member \> Paste GitHub username. 
Note there are separate Teams for Champions Cohorts and workshops.

- [NASA-Openscapes GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams)
- [NMFS-Openscapes GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-openscapes-workshops/teams)

![](images/github-add-to-team.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="600"}

GitHub may ask you for 2-factor authentication for the first one you add in a batch, not after that.

People may see invitation notifications in two ways; in GitHub itself, and/or 
via email. They must accept the invitation to be able to access the Hub. This is 
what it looks like in their email inbox:

![](images/github-notification-email.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="600"}

This is what the invitation looks like in the GitHub website interface - clicking the yellow banner notification leads to the invitation:

![](images/github-notification-banner.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="85%"}

![](images/github-notification-banner-part2.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

### 6. Email confirmation

Go back to the Google form response and grab their email address. Send the following email to the person.

**Email for General requests:** 

> Subject: [NASA/NMFS] Openscapes Access to 2i2c Hub
> 
> Hi \[FIRST NAME\],
>
> I have added you to the [NASA/NMFS] Openscapes 2i2c Jupyter Hub. Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.cloud/>
>
> There is a getting started guide in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook here: <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/>. 
> You can see policies for hub use here: <https://openscapes.cloud/access-policies.html>, 
> and policies and best practices for data storage here <https://openscapes.cloud/data-storage.html>
>
> We'd love to know about the kind of work you are doing on the hub. Please add a brief description of your progress as you go at <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2i2cAccessPolicies/discussions/2>. We will follow up in the next few months. 
>
> Best,

<!-- TODO: Will we have a "Discussions" place for NMFS cloud stories? -->


### 7. Register date in Form Response Sheet

In the Form Response Sheet 
([NASA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgokoQa-jYncYSOjeYoWYRuDAbyo4uUR-MSzUotvM00/edit?resourcekey#gid=1416760746)/
[NOAA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e-ysoYDdpe3DHs0j_ZkuNKpkYnU1qX554cBVTwyM3H0/edit?resourcekey=&gid=270874439#gid=270874439)), 
in column `Added to 2i2c hub` add the date they were added to the Hub, or if the
request came via email add a new row - in part so that we as admins knew if 
someone had already fulfilled the request. Check Column A for the date of the 
form request.

### Directions for invitees

1.  Please go to:
 - NASA: <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops> 
 - NMFS: <https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes>

2.  Click the big yellow bar that says "you've been invited" 

3.  Not seeing that bar? 

    1.  Are you logged into [GitHub.com](https://github.com)?

    2.  Have you shared your GitHub username via the Google Form ([NASA](https://forms.gle/htV2PxJwRaP8jDpC6)/[NOAA](https://forms.gle/mP9E46xnJWjFhgmk7))?

    3.  You can also check your email that you use for GitHub and look for an invitation from GitHub and Openscapes

## Adding Champions cohorts as a batch

Participants in the NASA-Openscapes Champions program workshops are given Openscapes 
2i2c JupyterHub access, as are participants in certain workshops run by NASA or 
NOAA Openscapes Mentors.

::: {.callout-note}
We have a newly developed process for giving people short-term access to the hub 
for workshops, with low overhead for instructors and participants. This process 
removes the need to add people to a GitHub team, and gives participants "just 
in time" access to a special workshop hub with a username and shared 
workshop-specific password. Instructions for this simplified setup are 
[here](workshop-access.qmd#workshop-hub-access-via-shared-password).
:::

We use a dedicated GitHub Organization - [nasa-openscapes-workshops](https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops) - to manage access, with [GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams) for NASA-Openscapes Champions Cohorts and certain workshops.

### 1. Create a team in [nasa-openscapes-workshops](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams)

<!-- TODO: Check if we will make a nmfs-openscapes-workshops org, and if so make 
this applicable to both -->

There are several teams in this organization; the `AdminTeam` team is for 
members who have permission to create teams and add members to teams.

- If this is for a new champions cohort, name the team `nasa-champions-yyyy`
- If this is for a one-off workshop, name the team `[workshop-name]-[workshop-date]`, with 
workshop date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`

### 2. Add team name to workshop registry

We keep a registry of all NASA-Openscapes workshops in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sg4fMDGxMLI0p5cgK5xyamFJpKC6NyNneqXLDReSKcg/edit#gid=695033382). Add the name 
of the GitHub team to `2i2c access type` column in the appropriate row.

### 3. Add teams to 2i2c Hub configuration

Make a pull request to the relevant `common.values.yaml` configuration file in 
the 2i2c infrastructure repository:

- [NASA-Openscapes `common.values.yaml`](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/main/config/clusters/openscapes/common.values.yaml)
- [NMFS-Openscapes `common.values.yaml`](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/main/config/clusters/nmfs-openscapes/common.values.yaml)

Add the new team to the `allowed-teams` item in whichever sections are 
appropriate for your workshop/cohort (likely all of them):

- `display_name: Python`
- `display_name: R`
- `display_name: Matlab`
- `display_name: "Bring your own image"`

These will determine which images are available to participants when they log in 
to the Hub.

Team specification is in the form `[github-org]:[team]` (e.g., `nasa-openscapes-workshops:champions-access-2i2c-2024`)

You also need to add the team to the `allowed_organizations` item under 
`hub > config > GitHubOAuthenticator`

You can see an example pull request [here](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/3944).

### 4. Share Google Form with participants needing access for the cohort or workshop

Ask users: Please add your GitHub Username to the Google form:

- [Google form for NASA Openscapes JupyterHub Access](https://forms.gle/htV2PxJwRaP8jDpC6) 
- [Google form for NMFS Openscapes JupyterHub Access](https://forms.gle/mP9E46xnJWjFhgmk7)

### 5. Add users to a Team in a batch using [kyber](https://github.com/Openscapes/kyber)

::: {.callout-tip}
Do this fairly close to the day of the workshop to try to get the greatest 
number participants to have filled out the form, and reduce the number of manual 
additions on the day of the workshop.
:::

1. Open the spreadsheet of form responses 
([NASA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgokoQa-jYncYSOjeYoWYRuDAbyo4uUR-MSzUotvM00/edit?resourcekey#gid=1416760746)/
[NOAA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e-ysoYDdpe3DHs0j_ZkuNKpkYnU1qX554cBVTwyM3H0/edit?resourcekey=&gid=270874439#gid=270874439)),
select the GitHub usernames from the rows containing the people you want to add,
and copy it to your clipboard.

::: {.callout-tip}
Some workshop instructors will use their own form to record participants,
rather than the Openscapes form. In that case use those responses instead. But 
do paste all those rows into this Main form; it is important that we have a 
record of everyone using the Hub and a way to contact them via email.
:::

2. In R, do the following:

```r
library(kyber)
library(datapasta)

# Run datapasta::tribble_paste() or use the RStudio Addin 'Paste as tribble'

# assign the pasted output to a new object:
responses <- tribble::tribble(
    # The stuff that was pasted
)
```

The `responses` object will have a column of usernames. It likely won't be 
called `username`, so you can rename it or even easier, change the name inside
the `tribble::tribble()` call that you pasted. Verify these are the usernames
you want to add, and run `kyber::add_team_members()` as follows, choosing the 
appropriate GitHub organization and team.

```r
team_name <- "the name of the github team you want to add to"
org_name <- "the name of the github org that contains the team"

add_team_members(
  team_name, 
  members = responses$username, 
  org = org_name
)
```

3. Go the appropriate team in the relevant GitHub organization and verify that 
there are the appropriate "pending members":

![](images/github-pending-member.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="399"}

4. Go back to the spreadsheet of responses, and fill in the 
`Added to NASA/NMFS 2i2c hub` column with the date you added them.

### Directions for workshop participants

1.  Please go to:
 - NASA: <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops> 
 - NMFS: <https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes>

2.  Click the big yellow bar that says "you've been invited" 

3.  Not seeing that bar? 

    1.  Are you logged into [GitHub.com](https://github.com)?

    2.  Have you shared your GitHub username via the Google Form ([NASA](https://forms.gle/htV2PxJwRaP8jDpC6)/[NOAA](https://forms.gle/mP9E46xnJWjFhgmk7))?

    3.  You can also check your email that you use for GitHub and look for an invitation from GitHub and Openscapes

## Troubleshooting

### Users get 403 error

This is a common issue. User must find email notification from GitHub and accept invitation. If they had clicked in email to accept but did not complete accepting in GitHub, edit their invitation in GitHub to uninvite and reinvite. They should get a new email to accept.

![](images/github-pending-member.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="399"}

### Didn't get email

Go to <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops>, see the big yellow bar that says You're invited.
