## Using the Openscapes 2i2c Hub in a workshop

- Check with the [primary contact for your hub](about.qmd#primary-contacts) 
  that the Hub image has the packages you need
- Reach out to 2i2c _a month in advance_ via an email to `support at 2i2c.freshdesk.com` 
  (examples below) to tell them about the workshop date, start and end times, 
  \# of participants, anticipated level of resources to be used, access 
  method, and if appropriate, a desired password.

We divide types of workshops into two different categories, with different
access patterns:

### Workshop Hub Access via Shared Password

If you are hosting a workshop that has a large number of participants, especially
if they are not all comfortable with GitHub and participants do not require
access to the Hub when the workshop is complete, use the "shared password" 
access. This access method allows the instructors to share a single password
with learners at the start of the workshop which they can use to log on the the 
Hub.

Tell your learners that they will be able to access the Hub using the shared
password for one week following the workshop, after which the password will
be changed and the their home directories inside the Hub will be removed.

One week after the workshop, send another email to `support at 2i2c.freshdesk.com`
and request that the password be reset and users' home directories from the
workshop be removed.

### Workshop Hub Access via GitHub Teams

If you are hosting a workshop with where you will be teaching GitHub workflows, 
or learners who require longer-term access to the Hub after the workshop, 
follow the instructions to [add participants to the 2i2c Hub](longterm-access.qmd) 
via a GitHub Team. Then send an email to `support at 2i2c.freshdesk.com`:
