## Introduction

A key objective of Openscapes is to minimize “the time to science” for researchers. Cloud infrastructure can facilitate shortening this time. We use a 2i2c-managed JupyterHub, which lets us work in the cloud next to NASA Earthdata in AWS region US-West-2. The purpose of the JupyterHub is to provide initial, exploratory experiences with cloud computing. It is not meant to be a long-term solution to support on-going science work or software development. For those users that decide working in the Cloud is advantageous and want to move there, we support a migration from the Hub to their own environment through Coiled.io. 

**Hub Management:** [2i2c](http://2i2c.org/) is a nonprofit that designs, develops, and operates JupyterHubs in the cloud for research and education, including Openscapes. 2i2c ensures that Hubs are cloud-vendor agnostic and are built using open-source software such as JupyterHub and Kubernetes. 

**User Management and Access:** 2i2c manages users through GitHub Teams within a GitHub organization managed for each Hub. This requires new users to accept an invitation to join the relevant GitHub team. Following that acceptance, the user can then log on to the 2i2c Hub with their Github credentials. The only software requirements to launch the Hub are access to a computer and the internet.

**Hub Location and Right to Replicate:** Our Openscapes JupyterHub is built on top of AWS and is in-region with NASA Earthdata (AWS US-West-2). 2i2c gives users the [right to replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/) their infrastructure. This means that our Hub could be replicated on GoogleEarthEngine or Microsoft Azure, or ported to another AWS region.

With this setup, we have flexibility to support a diverse range of user needs. The 2i2c Openscapes Hub has been used by the NASA-Openscapes Mentors and other NASA DAAC staff internally as a testing ground for developing cloud tutorials and workflows, but also externally in the research community for workshops like those for science teams and “Hackathons”, a term used here to describe multi-day events with split time for teaching and helping researchers implement concepts into their research projects.

## Computing evironment

The computing environment in the JuptyerHubs is provided by [Docker 
container images](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/), enabling a 
reproducible software environment for all users on the hub. These images contain 
the development environment (JupyterLab, RStudio, VSCode etc), as well as the 
software stack and the dependencies for R and Python based workflows, as
well as MATLAB and QGIS. Each Hub has a set of preselected images users can 
choose from when they log in, or users can provide their own image.

### Core Images

- [corn](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/corn): The base image for Python-based
  workflows using NASA Earthdata.
- [py-rocket](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/py-rocket): The base image for 
  R-based workflows using NASA Earthdata.
