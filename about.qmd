## Introduction

A key objective of NASA Openscapes is to minimize “the time to science” for researchers. Cloud infrastructure can facilitate shortening this time. We use a 2i2c-managed JupyterHub, which lets us work in the cloud next to NASA Earthdata in AWS US-West-2. The purpose of the JupyterHub is to provide initial, exploratory experiences accessing NASA Earthdata in the cloud. It is not meant to be a long-term solution to support on-going science work or software development. For those users that decide working in the Cloud is advantageous and want to move there, we support a migration from the Hub to their own environment through Coiled.io. 

**Hub Management:** [2i2c](http://2i2c.org/) is a nonprofit that designs, develops, and operates JupyterHubs in the cloud for research and education, including NASA Openscapes. 2i2c ensures that Hubs are cloud-vendor agnostic and are built using open-source software such as JupyterHub and Kubernetes. 

**User Management and Access:** 2i2c manages users through GitHub Teams within the NASA-Openscapes GitHub organization. This requires new users to accept an invitation from NASA-Openscapes. Following that acceptance, the user can then log on to the 2i2c Hub with their Github credentials. Using the NASA Openscapes Hub, the only software requirement to launch the Hub are access to a computer and the internet.

**Hub Location and Right to Replicate:** Our Openscapes JupyterHub is built on top of AWS and is in-region with NASA Earthdata (AWS US-West-2). 2i2c gives users the [right to replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/) their infrastructure. This means that our Hub could be replicated on GoogleEarthEngine or Microsoft Azure, or ported to another AWS region.

With this setup, we have flexibility to support a diverse range of user needs. The 2i2c Openscapes Hub has been used by the NASA-Openscapes Mentors and other NASA DAAC staff internally as a testing ground for developing cloud tutorials and workflows, but also externally in the research community for workshops like those for science teams and “Hackathons”, a term used here to describe multi-day events with split time for teaching and helping researchers implement concepts into their research projects.
