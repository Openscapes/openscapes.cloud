## Introduction

A key objective of Openscapes is to minimize “the time to science” for researchers. Cloud infrastructure can facilitate shortening this time. We use a 2i2c-managed JupyterHub, which lets us work in the cloud next to NASA Earthdata in AWS region US-West-2. The purpose of the JupyterHub is to provide initial, exploratory experiences with cloud computing, and to provide a platform for running workshops. It is not meant to be a long-term solution to support on-going science work or software development. For those users that decide working in the Cloud is advantageous and want to move there, we support a migration from the Hub to their own environment through Coiled.io.

**Hub Management:** [2i2c](http://2i2c.org/) is a nonprofit that designs, develops, and operates JupyterHubs in the cloud for research and education, including Openscapes. 2i2c ensures that Hubs are cloud-vendor agnostic and are built using open-source software such as JupyterHub and Kubernetes. 

**User Management and Access:** Users are given access to the hub based on their 
reason for accessing the hub, and the length of time they will need access. Short-term
access for shorter workshops is differentiated from longer-term access for cloud 
experimentation, Openscapes Champions Cohorts, and longer workshops. See our
[Access Policies](access-policies.qmd) for details.

**Hub Location and Right to Replicate:** Our Openscapes JupyterHub is built on top of AWS and is in-region with NASA Earthdata (AWS US-West-2). 2i2c gives users the [right to replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/) their infrastructure. This means that our Hub could be replicated on GoogleEarthEngine or Microsoft Azure, or ported to another AWS region.

With this setup, we have flexibility to support a diverse range of user needs. The 2i2c Openscapes Hub has been used by the NASA-Openscapes Mentors and other NASA DAAC staff internally as a testing ground for developing cloud tutorials and workflows, but also externally in the research community for workshops like those for science teams and “Hackathons”, a term used here to describe multi-day events with split time for teaching and helping researchers implement concepts into their research projects.

## Computing evironment

The computing environment in the JuptyerHubs is provided by [Docker 
container images](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/), enabling a 
reproducible software environment for all users on the hub - the only software 
requirements to use the Hub are access to a computer and the internet. The images contain 
the development environment (JupyterLab, RStudio, VSCode etc), as well as the 
software stack and the dependencies for R and Python based workflows, and 
optionally other software such as MATLAB and QGIS. Each Hub has a set of 
images users can choose from when they log in, or users can provide their own image.
