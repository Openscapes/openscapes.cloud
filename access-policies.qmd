<!-- two categories of use: experimenting and workshops; relate usage categories to access modes; and link to relevant access instructions for each --> 

### Obtaining Access to the NASA Openscapes Hub

Access is controlled by the NASA Openscapes Team, who oversee the management of the Hub and Cloud costs. The first step to gaining access to the NASA Openscapes 2i2c Hub is to request access via [this form](https://forms.gle/sLM9szAYN2mq6SbL9). 

Our JupyterHub users are managed in three GitHub Teams: 

* [Long-term access](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams/longtermaccess-2i2c): This access is for NASA Openscapes mentors and team, DAAC staff and others who request a longer-term engagement  
* NASA Openscapes Champions: This access is for teams that participate in the NASA Openscapes Champions Program. These teams have access for up to a year as they migrate their workflows to the Cloud. 
* Workshops and Hackathons: This provides short term access of up to 1-month to participants of NASA Earthdata workshops. Participants will be removed at any time and have no expectation of on-going storage in their home directories.

Instructions for admins on how to add people to the hub can be found [here](add-folks-to-2i2c-github-teams.qmd).

### Allowable Uses of 2i2c Hub 

Users who join these GitHub teams agree to use the NASA Openscapes Hub only for work on NASA EarthData related activities. Generally, recommended instance size is the smallest instance (1.9GB RAM and up to 3.75 CPUs). 

Run large or parallel jobs over large geographic bounding boxes or over long temporal extents should be cleared with the NASA Openscapes Team by submitting an issue to the [2i2cAccessPolicies repository]( https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2i2cAccessPolicies).   

### Removal From the NASA Openscapes Hub

The NASA Openscapes Hub is a shared, limited resource that incurs real costs. Users are granted access in the terms above and are removed at the end of those limits. Users that havenâ€™t accessed the Hub in more than six months are also removed for security purposes. 

We will do our best to alert users before they lose access to the NASA Openscapes Hub. However, we reserve the right to remove users at any time for any reason. Users that violate the terms of access or incur large Cloud costs without prior permission from the NASA Openscapes Team will be removed immediately.

## Data storage policies

Policies on data storage and use of the `HOME` directory can be found in the [data policies page](data-policies.qmd).

## Monitoring cloud usage costs

### AWS Cost Explorer

<!-- TODO: Integrate/add links to monthly cost/storage report being developed at  -->

*This is a work in progress, currently with minimal steps and screenshots that we will augment.*

AWS Cost Explorer lets you examine how much your usage costs. When using Credits, your usage does not immediately show up. Select Charge type as "Usage" from the right menu.

### AWS Budgeting Alerts

*This is a work in progress, currently with minimal steps and screenshots that we will augment.*

There are two types of alerts we set up.

#### Budgeting alerts

When adding new Cloud credits to our AWS account, we also create a budget and alerts (received via email) as we spend our credits. These are some beginning notes (credit and thank you to Joe Kennedy!).

Create an annual budget of the total Credits left (you may need to calculate this if credits rolled over at the beginning of the calendar year). In the Budget menu, create a Budget. Then select Customize and Cost budget.

Exclude Credits and Refunds, include Discounts. You can elect to receive emails with a regular cadence: weekly, monthly.

We set these up at 50, 75, 90, 95% of the total budget, and we will receive emails at those percentages. The thinking is that we will need to request more credits starting at 50-75%, and then make sure we have them in hand by 90-95%.

#### Threshold alerts

We can also set up email alerts at certain dollar amounts.

We receive emails when we spend \$100, \$200, \$500 of our Credits, which show up in the system as \$1000 intervals.
