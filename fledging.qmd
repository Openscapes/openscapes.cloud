title: "Fledging"
---

Fledging is a goal of these JupyterHubs, so that users who have had success
and want to continue their adventures in cloud computing, have the knowledge
and resources to develop their own solutions.

Here is a [presentation on fledging](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-TiPN8bfY6iDL5EVcEuCQSjqFMs3jPSX2MlNWA6no2E/edit#slide=id.g2ece79fddf8_3_73) given at the Earth Science Information Partners
(ESIP) conference in July, 2024.

More resources coming soon...
