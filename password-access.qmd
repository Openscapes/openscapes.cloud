title: "Password-based Access"

This page is written primarily for workshop leads (mentors and other partners) who will be inviting participants to sign in to the hub on the day of the workshop, without using GitHub for authentication.

## Using the Openscapes 2i2c Hub in a workshop using a shared password

### Instructions for workshop leads

If you are hosting a workshop that has a large number of participants, especially
if workflows with GitHub are not part of the teaching curriculum, use the "shared password" 
access. This access method allows the instructors to share a single password
with learners at the start of the workshop which they can use to log on the the 
Hub. Note that while this access method is nicely streamlined for workshop leads 
and participants, Hub admins do not have any way to contact the people added to 
the Hub. Thus, participants with this method are only allowed to stay in the Hub
for one week before being removed.

- Check with the [primary contact/admin for your hub](about.qmd#primary-contacts) to 
  ensure that the Hub image has the packages you need
- Reach out to 2i2c _a month in advance_ via an email to `support at 2i2c.freshdesk.com` 
  (example below), cc-ing the primary contacts for your hub, to tell them about the workshop date, start and end times, 
  \# of participants, and anticipated level of resources to be used. Also tell
  them that you would like to use the shared password hub, and provide a desired 
  password.
- *Do not* ask your workshop particants to request access via the access request Google form - it is not necessary for these types of workshops.

:::

Tell your learners that they will be able to access the Hub using the shared
password during and for one week following the workshop, after which the password will
be changed and the their home directories inside the Hub will be removed.

One week after the workshop, send another email to `support at 2i2c.freshdesk.com` 
(again cc the hub's primarty contacts) and request that the password be reset 
and users' home directories from the workshop be removed.

### Instructions for Openscapes hub admins

1. When the workshop request is made, record the new workshop password in the 
[SharedPasswords-Openscapes.Cloud Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y4qzqWLsKHTNzuQi-fOaHGud0Ld_q1GHAzhS9-grV7Q/edit?gid=0#gid=0), and 
work with the workshop lead and 2i2c to ensure the hub will meet their needs
and will be available when they need it.

2. Record the workshop in the [workshop registry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sg4fMDGxMLI0p5cgK5xyamFJpKC6NyNneqXLDReSKcg/edit#gid=695033382). 
Put "SinglePassword" in the `2i2c access type` column in the appropriate row.

3. Seven days after the workshop finishes, coordinate with the workshop lead to 
make a request to 2i2c to change the password. Record this change in the Google sheet.

## Workshop Hub Access via GitHub Teams

If you are hosting a workshop with where you will be teaching GitHub workflows, 
and/or have learners who require longer-term access to the Hub after the workshop, 
follow the instructions to [add participants to the 2i2c Hub](github-access.qmd#adding-champions-or-workshop-participants-to-the-hub-as-a-batch) 
via a GitHub Team.
